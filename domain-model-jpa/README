In order to create a derby database to run the project, do the following:

1. Find the "Data Source Explorer" view
1.1 if not open, open it from Window > Show View > Other... > Data Management > Data Source Explorer

2. Create a connection to the Derby Database from the Data Source Explorer view. For that:
2.1 From the context menu on "Database Connections" select "New ..."
2.2 Select the Derby database
2.3 If no Derby Driver Created yet, select the not created yet, create a new Driver, 
by pressing the circle with the + icon (the first after the combo box)
2.3.1 Select "Derby Embedded JDBC Driver ",  version 10.2
2.3.2 In the JAR list tab select the derby.jar and press the "Edit JAR/Zip" button
2.3.3 The derby jar driver is in the .m2 folder in your home dir. The full path is
/yourHomeDir/.m2/repository/org/apache/derby/derby/10.12.1.1/derby-10.12.1.1.jar
2.3.4 Connection properties:
- Database location: TheLocationOfYourDomainModelJPAFolder/data/derby/css000. 
The connection will create the derby folders in case they do not exists.
- Username: css000
- Password: css000
URL: jdbc:derby:TheSameFolderAsInTheDatabaseLocation;create=true
(it should be updated automatically)
2.3.5 Press the "Test Connection" button to check that everything is ok
2.4 If you already have a Derby Driver, select it from the combobox

3. Associate the connection with the project
3.1 Select the project
3.2 From the context menu > properties > JPA
3.3 In the Platform choose Eclipse Link 2.4.x/2.5.x
3.4 In the Connection select the connection you just created

4. Generate database tables from the context menu > JPA Tools > Generate tables from entities

5. Force JPA validation by changing and entity (adding a space somewhere) and saving the files.

6. Your project should be error free now 

7. Insert Discont types, units, and products in the database
7.1 open the load-script.sql file from src/main/resources/META-INF/load-script.sql
7.2 fill the fields on top:
Type: Derby 10.x
Name: your connection name
Database: css000
7.3 from the context menu (in the load-script editor) choose the "Execute All"
7.4 In the SQL Results view observe that the delete and insert commands execute
without errors. Every time you need to reset the database data, rerun the script

8. Copy the persistence-derby.xml to persistence.xml
(in folder src/main/resources/META-INF)

9. You can now run the startup.Startup

10. If you want to run using the MySql database
10.1 create a connection to the dbserver as explained before for the Derby connection
10.2 select the MySql driver in 
/yourHomeDir/.m2/repository/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.38/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38.jar

10.3 The connection information is
Database: css000
URL: jdbc:mysql://dbserver.alunos.di.fc.ul.pt:3306/css000
User name: css000
Password: css000

Ping the connection. Do not forget to turn on the FCUL VPN connection.

10.4 Associate the connection with the project as before
10.5 Create the database as before
10.6 Run the script to populate the database. Now you need to select 
Mysql, the connection and the css000 database. 

10.7 Copy the persistence-mysql.xml to persistence.xml
(in folder src/main/resources/META-INF)

10.8 you can run the same application but now using a MySQL database
